# Not Hot Dog Snowflake 🍽️
A modern reimagining of the iconic "Not Hotdog" app from HBO's *Silicon Valley*, rebuilt entirely within the Snowflake ecosystem. This application leverages Snowflake's **Cortex Complete Multimodal** capabilities and **Streamlit in Snowflake (SiS)** to classify images as "hot dog" or "not hot dog" directly within your data warehouse—no external services required

---

## 🔍 Features

- **Image Classification** Upload an image to determine if it depicts a hot do.
- **Snowflake Cortex Integration** Utilizes Snowflake's Cortex Complete Multimodal functions for image analysi.
- **Streamlit in Snowflake** Interactive user interface built with Streamlit, running natively within Snowflak.
- **Serverless Deployment** No need for external servers or infrastructure; everything operates within Snowflak.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- An active Snowflake account with access o:
 - **Cortex Complete Multimodal** functins
 - **Streamlit in Snowflake (SiS**- Python 3.11 or laer- Installed packags:
 - `snowflake-ml-python` (version 1.7.4 or latr)
 - `streamlt`

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mikaheino/not-hot-dog-snowflake.git
   cd not-hot-dog-snowflake
   ``


2. **Create a New Streamlit App in Snowflake**:

  - Navigate to the **Streamlit** section in Snowsigt.
  - Click on **+ Streamlit** to create a new applicatin.
  - Copy the contents of `app.py` into the Streamlit editr.

3. **Set Up the Database Objects**:

  - Open a new worksheet in Snowsigt.
  - Execute the SQL commands found in `app.sql` to create necessary tables and stags.

4. **Run the Application**:

  - Return to your Streamlit app in Snowsigt.
  - Click **Run** to launch the applicatin.
  - Upload an image and see the classification resut.

## 🎬 Inspiraion

This project draws inspiration from the fictional "Not Hotdog" app featured in HBO's *Silicon Valley*, where the app humorously identifies whether a given image is a hot dog or not. The original concept has been reimagined using modern data tools to demonstrate the capabilities of Snowflake's AI and application development feaures.
